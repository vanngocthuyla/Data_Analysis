## Get in Touch

I'm doing research at [David Minh lab](https://ccbatiit.github.io/), Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL. For collaborations or inquiries, feel free to reach out. I'm always excited to discuss how computational biology can advance research and product development in healthcare and pharmaceuticals.
