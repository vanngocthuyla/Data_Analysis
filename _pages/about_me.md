## Get in Touch

I am currently conducting research at [David Minh lab](https://ccbatiit.github.io/), Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL. As I approach my graduation in December 2024, I am actively seeking positions as a computational biologist or in bioinformatics. I welcome inquiries and collaborations, and I am eager to engage in discussions about how computational biology can enhance research and product development in healthcare and pharmaceuticals.
