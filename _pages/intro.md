I am a **computational biologist** with a strong focus on **molecular biology** and **chemical biology**. My work centers on developing and applying innovative approaches to integrate and interpret **omics data** (WES/WGS, RNA-seq) and **high-throughput screening data** (pharmacological screens). By leveraging these methods, I help deliver key insights into the molecular mechanisms of diseases, provide predictions to optimize experimental designs, and guide product development in drug discovery.

I specialize in utilizing **statistical models** and **machine learning** techniques to analyze complex datasets, constructing workflows that streamline data processing and interpretation. My expertise spans transcriptomics, genomics, and drug design, with a particular focus on Bayesian modeling to quantify uncertainty in biological systems.

# Expertise & Professional Experiences

**Transcriptomic analysis**

I analyze RNA-seq data to gain a deeper understanding of gene expression dynamics. My transcriptomic work includes:

- Profiling RNA transcripts under specific biological conditions or in particular cell types.
- Performing homology-based annotation to uncover the functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
- Identifying crucial markers for distinguishing cell subtypes.
- Quantifying gene expression to reveal insights into transcriptional regulation.

**Genomic analysis**

I work on identifying genomic variations and abnormalities that drive diseases, particularly using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Some of my key projects include:

- Detecting chromosomal anomalies in human WGS data for early diagnosis of genetic disorders.
- Pre-diagnosing breast cancer through copy number variant (CNV) detection using WES data.

**Drug Design & Pharmacological Insights**

My work in drug design focuses on improving data analysis methods for pharmacological screening. Key achievements include:

- Enhancing concentration-response curve fitting by incorporating control data, leading to more accurate estimates of half-maximal concentrations.
- Applying Bayesian regression to quantify uncertainty in binding parameters from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, providing a more reliable analysis than traditional error propagation methods.

**Bayesian Modeling**

I utilize Bayesian modeling techniques to improve predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. This includes:

- Comparing Bayesian frameworks such as NumPyro, Pyro, and PyMC3 for analyzing ITC data.
- Using Bayesian regression and model selection to study binding affinities in enantiomeric mixtures through ITC.
