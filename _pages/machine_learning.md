In my work with transcriptomics, I developed and executed RNA-Seq pipelines, focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate algorithms for the data being analyzed. The project involved gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data processed through RSEM for expression measurement. I further refined the data by filtering out genes with zero expression values and applying quantile normalization to ensure consistency across samples.

Once the data tables were prepared, I utilized machine learning algorithms to classify these subtypes automatically, identifying the most informative genes for distinguishing between the known classes. I also employed unsupervised techniques to explore potential inherent groupings within the data by analyzing the full transcriptome.
