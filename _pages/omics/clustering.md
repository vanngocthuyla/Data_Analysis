Clustering Based on One Data Type
As we explored in previous sections on classification and feature selection, gene expression data can reliably identify cancer subtypes. Next, we will investigate whether it is possible to uncover subtype separations in an unsupervised manner using only transcriptomic data. Specifically, we will employ clustering techniques to group samples based on their similarities.

Hierarchical Clustering
The definition of similarity, especially between clusters, can significantly impact the outcomes of hierarchical clustering. Generally, clustering methods calculate the similarities between individual samples and then aggregate these similarities into a collective measure for the clusters. Each method utilizes a specific metric for similarity computation.

In this study, I applied agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering, which begins by assigning each sample to its own distinct cluster. The algorithm identifies the pair of most similar samples and merges them into a single cluster, treating them as a "quasi-sample." This merging process continues until all samples are consolidated into one cluster. The results are typically visualized as a dendrogram, which illustrates the sequence in which clusters are merged. The height of the branches in this tree indicates the level of similarity between clusters; greater heights reflect higher dissimilarity. By cutting the dendrogram at a specific height, I can achieve clusters of desired sizesâ€”making a cut closer to the leaves results in more smaller clusters, while a cut near the root yields fewer larger clusters.

For this analysis, I utilized a dataset comprising 52 samples as input for clustering. The resulting dendrogram revealed that similar samples were grouped together. For instance, samples S03, S04, and S05 formed a small branch, while S12, S13, and S14 were located in a branch significantly distant from the first. If the number of clusters is set to five, the algorithm will return the assigned cluster for each sample.
