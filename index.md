## About Me

Welcome to my website! I am a computational biologist with a strong focus on molecular biology and chemical biology. I specialize in utilizing statistical models and machine learning, constructing analysis pipelines and workflows, and integrating complex data to bridge scientific knowledge gaps, drive research, and support practical applications. I invite you to explore the details on the [Research](https://vanngocthuyla.github.io/research) page.

I am currently conducting research at [CCB Lab](https://ccbatiit.github.io/), Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL.  I welcome inquiries and collaborations, and I am eager to engage in discussions about how computational biology can enhance research and product development for human health.
