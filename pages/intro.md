I am a computational biologist who focuses on chemical biology. I develop and apply analytical approaches to integrate and interpret omics (WES/WGS, RNA-Seq), and high-throughput screen (pharmacological screen) data. These are helpful for delivering insights into biological diseases, provide outcome prediction to design experiments, and guide product development.

I can utilize statistical models, machine learning methods, and construct workflow for data analysis. Some of my achievements are described below.

**Transcriptomic analysis**
- Profiling the set of RNA transcripts under specific circumstances or in specific cells.
- Homology-based annotation for the list of DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) in interest
- Identification important markers for cell subtypes
- Quantification to understand transcriptional regulation

**Genomic analysis**
- Identification of Abnormality by in human whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data
- Pre-diagnosis of breast cancer by copy number variant (CNV) detection using human whole exome sequencing (WES) data

**Exploring binding processes and improving the data analysis for drug design**
- Inclusion of Control Data in Fits to Concentration-Response Curves Improves Estimates of Half-Maximal Concentrations
- Bayesian Regression Quantifies Uncertainty of Binding Parameters from Isothermal Titration Calorimetry More Accurately Than Error Propagation

**Bayesian modeling**
- Comparison of the three PPLs (numpyro, pyro and pymc3) for running the ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) data
- Bayesian Regression and Model Selection for Isothermal Titration Calorimetry with Enantiomeric Mixtures
