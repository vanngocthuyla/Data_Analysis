Transcriptome analysis can be used for many purposes:
- Profiling and [Annotation](https://vanngocthuyla.github.io/Data_Analysis/pages/sequencing/Annotation) of the set of RNA transcripts under specific circumstances or in specific cells. 
- Identification important markers for cell subtypes to classify [cell subtypes](https://vanngocthuyla.github.io/Data_Analysis/pages/sequencing/Classification_Clustering)
- Quantification to understand transcriptional regulation
